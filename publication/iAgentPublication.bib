@article{Chan:LNCS06:Loc,
	Abstract = {Location-aware services can benefit from accurate and reliable indoor
  location tracking. The widespread adoption of 802.11x wireless LAN
  as the network infrastructure creates the opportunity to deploy WiFi-based
  location services with few additional hardware costs. While recent
  research has demonstrated adequate performance, localization error
  increases significantly in crowded and dynamic situations due to
  electromagnetic interferences. This paper proposes collaborative
  localization as an approach to enhance position estimation by leveraging
  more accurate location information from nearby neighbors within the
  same cluster. The current implementation utilizes ZigBee radio as
  the neighbor-detection sensor. This paper introduces the basic model
  and algorithm for collaborative localization. We also report experiments
  to evaluate its performance under a variety of clustering scenarios.
  Our results have shown 28.2-56% accuracy improvement over the baseline
  system Ekahau, a commercial WiFi localization system.},

@article{Chan:LNCS06:Display,
	Abstract = {Many wall-size display systems are built to provide large-scale visualization.
  These systems may be quite successful for some limited applications,
  but are very inflexible, since these systems only have fixed display
  regions. This paper integrates steerable projectors whose beam can
  be moved under computer control onto a wall-size display system to
  strengthen its display ability. With the steerable projectors, the
  integrated display system, named Flexible Display, provide an extendable
  display region. This consists of a large-scale display region and
  several movable display regions, such that the integrated display
  system has great potential in the area of human-computer interaction
  and information visualization. This paper applies the Flexible Display
  to a virtual museum application to give the users fluent navigation
  experience. For the application, the Flexible Display provides the
  following functions: 1) intensity and resolution enhancement of sub-region
  of display wall, 2) information augmentation, and 3) ?stepping user
  interfaces? for its viewers interacting with display wall.},

	Review = {In this paper, a novel design and analysis of the dynamic game of the Hybrid Multi-Agent Robotic System (HMARS) is proposed for dealing with the formation problem of multiple robots with leaders and followers. Each autonomous agent is a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) with switching behaviors including target approach and obstacle avoidance. Under the well designed controller, an agent can perform formation tasks together with other agents in order to accomplish a cooperative mission. The top-down design method deals with not only logical conflicts but also optimal solution of the game at Nash equilibrium point. On the other hand, the bottom-up design method searches for the best performance on the local controller over continuous trajectory. In addition, reachibility is verified at the logical level. The contributions of this paper can be split into three parts: first, Lyapunov style formation control of a HMARS is developed based on reachibility, existence and stability issues under the hybrid approach; second, a dynamical cooperative game for HMARS is proposed and analyzed for the stability with Constrained Logic; third, we offer a framework to implement cooperation of HMARS with the innate characteristics from discrete event space to continuous state space.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a novel design and implementation of a hybrid system
  of the multiagent is proposed. First of all, a hybrid system is established
  to characterize different behaviors of an agent. From the well designed
  general Lyapunov base controller, the autonomous agent which is composed
  by wheeled mobile manipulator (WMM) switches well-depicted behaviors
  such as obstacle avoid, target approach, cruise, grasp etc. from
  the feedback signals. Next, a two-level control architecture is devised
  for the WMM system, where the first level mainly handles sensor feedback
  subject to sensor fusion, whereas the second level is responsible
  for providing a well performed supervisory control that can manipulate
  all available surrounding resources to successfully accomplish the
  aforementioned mission. In the Advanced Control Lab of Dept. of Electrical
  Engineering at National Taiwan University, an actual WMM is developed,
  named The Treasure Hunter (TTH), which is able to hunt treasures
  in an unknown environment whereby the effectiveness of the proposed
  approach is satisfactorily demonstrated.},

  and short-term health. In the traditional health care, professionals
  assess and weigh each individual?s dietary intake using intensive
  labor at high cost. In this paper, we design and implement a diet-aware
  dining table that can track what and how much we eat. To enable automated
  food tracking, the dining table is augmented with two layers of weighing
  and RFID sensor surfaces. We devise a weight-RFID matching algorithm
  to detect and distinguish how people eat. To validate our diet-aware
  dining table, we have performed experiments, including live dining
  scenarios (afternoon tea and Chinese-style dinner), multiple dining
  participants, and concurrent activities chosen randomly. Our experimental
  results have shown encouraging recognition accuracy, around 80%.
  We believe monitoring the dietary behaviors of individuals potentially
  contribute to diet-aware healthcare.},

	Abstract = {The coming ubiquity of digital media content is driving the need of
  a solution for improving the interaction between the people and media.
  In this work, we proposed a novel interaction technique, {QPalm},
  which allows the user to control the media via a list menu shown
  on a distant display by drawing circles in the air with one hand.
  To manipulate a list menu remotely, {QPalm} includes two basic functions,
  browse and choosing, realized by recognizing the user{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s palm performing
  circular and push motions in the air. The circular motion provides
  fluidity in scrolling a menu up and down, while push motion is intuitive
  when the user decided to choose an item during a circular motion.
  Based on this design, we develop a vision system based on a stereo
  camera to track the user{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s palm without interfering by intruders
  behind or next to the operating user. For more specifically, the
  contribution of the work includes: (1) an intuitive interaction technique,
  {QPalm}, for remote control with list menu, and (2) a palm tracking
  algorithm to support {QPalm} based on merely depth and motion information
  of images for a practical consideration.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an indoor localization system which improves localization
  by combining {ZigBee} radio and visual positioning techniques. Radio
  positioning is capable of locating people in a large area, while
  visual positioning only monitors the sub-areas covered by camera
  eld-of-views. However, when a crowd of people appear, radio positioning
  could be completely unstable while visual positioning can still obtain
  good observations. In this work, we take advantage of the two systems,
  and develop a preferable indoor localization system. The contributions
  of the work include: (1) a data association method which is proposed
  to decide the correspondences between the observations from the visual
  and radio positioning systems, and (2) A refinement method which
  utilizes the association results not only to preserve the location
  accuracy within people cluster, (3) but also to calibrate the radio
  map for better radio positioning. The system presented is applicable
  to a variety of existing radio and visual positioning techniques.
  The experimental results show that the visual supported radio localization
  system produces 41:1% improvement in positioning accuracy with people
  clusters in various situations.},

	Abstract = {Overly generalized predictions are a serious problem in concept classification.
  In particular, the boundaries among classes are not always clearly
  defined. For example, there are usually uncertainties in diagnoses
  based on data from biochemical laboratory examinations. Such uncertainties
  make the prediction be more difficult than noise-free data. To avoid
  such problems, the idea of fuzzy classification is proposed. This
  paper presents the basic definition of fuzzy classification trees
  along with their construction algorithm. Fuzzy classification trees
  is a new model that integrates the fuzzy classifiers with decision
  trees, that can work well in classifying the data with noise. Instead
  of determining a single class for any given instance, fuzzy classification
  predicts the degree of possibility for every class. Some empirical
  results the dataset from {UCI} Repository are given for comparing
  {FCT} and C4.5. Generally speaking, {FCT} can obtain better results
  than C4.5.},

  and respiration. For collecting physiological signal, subjects areconducted
  by mood induction video to reach the specific emotion state. The
  recognition system consists of emotion induction, feature extraction,
  and pattern classification stages.We adopt support vector machine
  to emotion classification problem. The resultsachieve high accuracy
  about 90%.Secondly, to minimize the number of sensors in experiments,
  we measure theimportance of each sensor by employing part of four
  sensors. Thirdly, we use thesignal of ``peace'' state as baseline
  value to calibrate all physiological signals.Finally, we apply calibration
  method to unseen data collected in another new day.The classification
  process is similar with real-time recognition. The result shows there
  is significant improvement in accuracy after calibration.For the
  application of emotion recognition system, we construct a prototype
  of emotion-aware music player. The system selects music dynamically
  according to user's emotion states. In the future, we can add more

	Abstract = {Semantic-level content analysis is a crucial issue in achieving efficient
  content retrieval and management. We propose a hierarchical approach
  that models the statistical characteristics of audio events over
  a time series to accomplish semantic context detection. Two stages,
  audio event and semantic context modeling, are devised to bridge
  the semantic gap between physical audio features and semantic concepts.
  In this work, hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to model four
  representative audio events, i.e., gunshot, explosion, engine, and
  car-braking, in action movies. At the semantic-context level, Gaussian
  mixture models (GMMs) and ergodic HMMs are investigated to fuse the
  characteristics and correlations between various audio events. They
  provide cues for detecting gunplay and car-chasing scenes, two semantic
  contexts we focus on in this work. The promising experimental results
  demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and exhibit
  that the proposed framework provides a foundation in semantic indexingand
  retrieval. Moreover, the two fusion schemes are compared, and the
  relations between audio event and semantic context are studied.},

  tools for modeling, searching, and extracting information from Web
  pages are indispensable. By modeling the structure of a Web page
  defined by its markup tags, one can easily extract target information
  using structural templates. This paper introduces the Tree Template
  Automatic Generator ({TTAG}) that learns tree-structured templates
  from training Web pages. {TTAG} was applied to both query-based and
  frequently updated Web sites, and produced effective templates from
  a small number of examples. The experiments show that {TTAG} is a
  powerful extraction tool for semi-structured information sources.},

	Abstract = {The keys to utilizing the potential of multi-robot systems are cooperation
  and coordination. Robots nowadays are equipped with better computing,
  high-bandwidth communication, and many kinds of sensors and actuators.
  Designing an effective robot team to achieve a global task is a big
  challenge. In addition, robots will face more uncertainties in an
  unknown or dynamic environment. The main investigation of this paper
  focuses on multiple robot coordination based on a market approach.
  In simulation experiment domain, a primitive simulation framework
  is built based on Webots software. The scenario can be divided into
  three technical domains: deadlock domain, specific uncertainty domain,
  and fewest robot strategy vs. best efficiency strategy domain. This
  paper demonstrates that, to achieve surveillance task, a group of
  robots can collaborate to detect emergencies in an indoor environment.},

@article{Hsu:ISF2006,
	Abstract = {Distributed trust management addresses the challenges of eliciting,
  evaluating and propagating trust for service providers on the distributed
  network. By delegating trust management to brokers, individual users
  can share their feedbacks for services without the overhead of maintaining
  their own ratings. This research proposes a two-tier trust hierarchy,
  in which a user relies on her broker to provide reputation rating
  about any service provider, while brokers leverage their connected
  partners in aggregating the reputation of unfamiliar service providers.
  Each broker collects feedbacks from its users on past transactions.
  To accommodate individual differences, personalized trust is modeled
  with a Bayesian network. Training strategies such as the expectation
  maximization ({EM}) algorithm can be deployed to estimate both server
  reputation and user bias. This paper presents the design and implementation
  of a distributed trust simulator, which supports experiments under
  different configurations. In addition, we have conducted experiments
  to show the following. 1) Personal rating error converges to below
  5% consistently within 10,000 transactions regardless of the training
  strategy or bias distribution. 2) The choice of trust model has a
  significant impact on the performance of reputation prediction. 3)
  The two-tier trust framework scales well to distributed environments.
  In summary, parameter learning of trust models in the broker-based
  framework enables both aggregation of feedbacks and personalized
  reputation prediction.},

  Problem ({DVRP}), new customer orders appear over time, and new routes
  must be reconfigured while executing the current solution. Montemanni
  et al. [1] considered a {DVRP} as an extension to the standard vehicle
  routing problem ({VRP}) by decomposing a {DVRP} as a sequence of
  static {VRPs}, and then solving them with an ant colony system ({ACS})
  algorithm. This paper presents a genetic algorithm ({GA}) methodology
  for providing solutions for the {DVRP} model employed in [1]. The
  effectiveness of the proposed {GA} is evaluated using a set of benchmarks
  found in the literature. Compared with a tabu search approach implemented
  herein and the aforementioned {ACS}, the proposed {GA} methodology
  performs better in minimizing travel costs.},

	Abstract = {Ubiquitous computing technology plays a key role for providing context
  information and makes context-aware services can be delivered in
  a smart space. As the contexts changing rapidly, context resources
  can be gathered from sensors, mobile devices, and personal information
  softwares. Consequently, a contextaware system must be aware of such
  environment changes so that it can provide adaptive and proactive
  services to the users. In addition, all the inner computing operations
  have to be hidden behind the users. We propose a Context-aware Service
  Platform, which is implemented in {JADE} agent platform and utilizes
  SemanticWeb technologies, to analyze the ambient contexts and contrive
  service plans.We integrated ontology and rule-based reasoning to
  automatically infer high-level contexts and deduce a goal of context-aware
  services. An AI planner decomposes complex services and establishes
  the execution plan. Agents perform the specified task to accomplish
  the service. A scalable / distributed hardware architecture implements
  the Context-aware Service Platform, and supports applications with
  distributed multi-agents embodied in objects throughout the smart
  space environment. A Smart Alarm Clock scenario demonstrates the
  detail functions of each agent and shows how these agents incorporate
  with each others.},

  For some tasks, such as holding a conference, cooperation among agents

  several services for users, such as making energy-ef?ciency schemes,
  providing energy-saving advices and automatic control. Our goal is
  to perform accurately monitoring for the states of multiple appliances
  via measuring electrical consumption from electric panel. We describe
  several features which we extract from the panel-level energy consumption
  and introduce the Bayes ?lter approach for tracking the states of
  appliances. We also evaluate the feasibility for this problem and
  compare the accuracy of our approach with some other mehtods, such
  as Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor(kNN) and Support Vector Machine(SVM).},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a distributed reputation and trust management
  framework that addresses the challenges of eliciting, evaluating
  and propagating reputation for web applications. We propose a broker
  framework where every user is associated with a reputation broker
  who collects for its users the reputation ratings about any web service.
  In return, a user provides its broker the service rating after each
  transaction with any service in order to build up the reputation
  for the service. In our mechanism design, brokers form a trust network
  where they exchange and collect reputation data about all services.
  By delegating trust management to brokers, individual users only
  need to check with their brokers about the reputation of a service
  before any transaction. We present the distributed reputation and
  trust management framework and show the performance of the system
  by simulations.},

	Abstract = {Personal experience computing is about computing support for recording,
  storing, retrieving, editing, analyzing, and sharing of personal
  experiences. In this paper, we present our design, implementation
  and evaluation of a mobile authoring tool called mProducer. mProducer
  enables a user to generate personal experience content using a mobile
  device anytime, anywhere. To address challenges in both limited system
  resources and user interface constraints on a mobile device, mProducer
  provides several innovative system techniques and UI designs. (1)
  The Storage Constrained Uploading (SCU) algorithm uploads large multimedia
  data to remote servers, in order to alleviate the problem of limited
  storage on a mobile device. (2) Sensor-Assisted Automated Editing
  utilizes a tilt sensor on the mobile device to automate the detection
  and removal of blurry frames resulting from excessive amount of camerashaking.
  This sensor-based solution requires small processing overhead, and
  it is considered a good alternative to computational-expensive image
  processing techniques for detecting shaking artifacts. (3) Map-based
  content management interface incorporates a GPS receiver on a mobile
  device to record location meta-data for each recording captured by
  a user, and enables easy, intuitive content navigation on a small
  screen. (4) Keyframe-based editing enables a user to edit content
  using only keyframes. We have conducted user studies to evaluate
  overall editing experience, user satisfaction in the editing quality,
  task performance time, ease-of-use, and learnability. The results
  of user studies have shown that keyframe-based editing works bestwith
  a storyboard interface. In general, users have found mProducer to
  be both fun and easy to use on a mobile device.},

  consists of five parts. The first part continuously monitors environmental
  loudness by a sensor node to detect the speaking event of a specific
  participant. The second part continuously captures a participant's
  video. The third part records all page change events within a presentation
  file. And the fourth part continuously captures the screen display
  of a presentation file. Finally, the fifth part demonstrates all
  recorded data and recognized events by simultaneous display for user
  review.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of
  a footstep based indoor location system. The traditional Japanese
  GETA sandals are equipped with force, ultrasonic, orientation, RFID
  sensors and an accelerometer to produce a wearable location tracking
  system that demand little infrastructure in the deployed environment.
  In its basic form, a user simply puts on GETA sandals to enable tracking
  of his/her locations relative to a starting point (e.g., a building
  entrance), making it easy for deployment everywhere. The footstep
  location system is based on dead-reckoning, which works by measuring
  and tracking displacement vectors along a trail of footsteps. Each
  displacement vector is formed by drawing a line between each pair
  of footsteps, and the position of a user can be calculated by summing
  up the current and all previous displacement vectors. Unlike most
  existing indoor location systems, the footstep based method does
  not suffer from problems with obstacles, multi-path effects, signal
  noises, signal interferences, and dead spots. There are two technical
  challenges in the proposed design: (1) location error accumulates
  over distance traveled, and (2) displacement measurements are sporadic
  during stair climbing. The first problem is addressed by a light
  RFID infrastructure, while the second problem is remedied by incorporating
  an accelerometer into the system. Experiments on GETA prototype are
  conducted to evaluate the positional accuracy of our system.},
