Hi, my name is Chi-Chia Huang. My friends usually call me Chi-Chia or Chi-Pang. I am currently pursuing PhD degrees in National Taiwan University. I received my mater's degree in computer science from NTU in 2009 and bachelor's degree in computer science from National Chiao Tung University in 2006. I have three years working experience in Insitute for Information Industry from 2009 to 2012.

My research interests are Machine Learning, Recommender System and Human Computer Interaction. Although I still do not have concrete idea, my goal is to make people feel that machines are intelligent, machines have thought, and machines can understand people’s need.
