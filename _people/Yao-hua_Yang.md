Hi, I am Yao-Hua Yang. I'm currently pursuing master degree in Nation Taiwan University.  I'm interested in finding ways to improve the quality of elders' life and the interaction between elders and children. I'm also enthusiastic about discovering the relation between data and the real person like recommender system or any other social network analysis problem. I'm still finding the topic on my research.... So, welcome for any seggestion.
