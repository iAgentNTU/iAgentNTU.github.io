I joined the Intelligent Agents Laboratory as an undergraduate in 2014 and received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2015.

After graduating with a B.Sc., Iâ€™ve been exploring new technology of data analytics as a full-time research assistant at the Intel-NTU Connected Context Computing Center in Taiwan. My main research interests lie within IoT technologies and machine learning.
