<p>The goal of this project is to retrieve important life fragments using a visual photo annotation interface and the familial stories behind the photos. We present the design of Picgo, a game-based reminiscence service that enables elders to capture memories, annotate photos, and iteratively reinforce the annotation of photos in a storytelling process. There are two main functions of the process of Picgo: (1) Capturing and Annotation; (2) Browsing and Reinforcement. Finally, by analyzing the relevance between the tags and calculating the impressive level of the photos, Picgo is able to provide meaningful reminiscent materials to caregivers and occupational therapists in reminiscence therapy that can trigger elders&rsquo; memory successfully.&nbsp;</p>
