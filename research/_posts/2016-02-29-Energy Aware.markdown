<p>Due to the increasing impacts of global warming and climate&nbsp;change,&nbsp;solutions for environmental protection and energy conservation&nbsp; have&nbsp;become a common pursuit
<script src="../../javascripts/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js?1267757233" type="text/javascript"></script>
throughout the world.  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">Given the  continued&nbsp;advances in technology,&nbsp;balancing the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">quality</span> and  <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">sustainability</span> of&nbsp;modern life&nbsp;requires joints efforts by the government, academia and the&nbsp;industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;On the other hand, developments in sensor technology&nbsp;and&nbsp;computing devices have enabled increasing applications of research&nbsp;on&nbsp;smart home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;This project aims to explore the role of  smart home&nbsp;technology in promoting awareness of environment&nbsp; protection and&nbsp;energy&nbsp;conservation,&nbsp;so as to lower the demand for  energy and to&nbsp;facilitate a&nbsp;healthy, safe, and comfortable lifestyle.</span></span></span></p>
<p>The primary objective of this research is to promote self-awareness o&nbsp;user&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;in terms of energy consumption, as well as one&rsquo;s &nbsp;responsibilities of&nbsp;being a global citizen. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">By monitoring energy&nbsp;consumption of various home&nbsp;appliances,&nbsp;a smart home environment is&nbsp;able to provide users with instant&nbsp;feedback on their behaviors in a&nbsp;non-instrusive fashion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;We will also&nbsp;establish&nbsp;energy conservation&nbsp;models,&nbsp;so as to encourage users to make&nbsp;proper&nbsp;tradeoffs between&nbsp;personal comfort and energy conservation.</span></span></p>
<p>In this project, we plan to acquire the basic energy consumption&nbsp;models&nbsp;using the PA300 electric meter to measure power usage of&nbsp;home&nbsp;appliances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;We will install a Zigbee-based wireless indoor&nbsp;location system&nbsp;for monitoring&nbsp;user locations&nbsp;within the smart&nbsp;environment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;The&nbsp;association&nbsp;model between&nbsp;user location and&nbsp;power consumption will be&nbsp;derived&nbsp;empirically.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;This project&nbsp;will&nbsp;analyze the impacts of environment&nbsp;and behavior&nbsp;parameters&nbsp;on energy&nbsp;consumption&nbsp;and propose energy&nbsp;conservation advices&nbsp;in an non-instrusive manner.</span></span></span></p>
