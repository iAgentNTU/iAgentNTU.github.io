<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12px;">The iCare research initiative is about embracing and embedding digital technology into our physical living to enhance our everyday experiences at home. Specifically, the iCare research seeks to create intelligent digital technology that can engage and excite people into active participation of desirable physical and mental activities at home that are considered healthy, creative, productive, educational, enjoyable, etc. Our goal is to develop digital technology that empowers people, not just supports smart environments. A current research focus is in applying digital technology for healthcare and self-care at home.</span></p>
<p>The iCare research initiative is an interdisciplinary research effort. Our original team members come from mostly computing background, but have since been extended to cover diverse background in electrical engineering, computer science, information management, occupational therapy, psychology, medicine, and nursing, enabling us to tackle the research challenge of digital living from technical, design, and human aspects.</p>
