<p>Digital technology has great potentials for creating an intelligent space that supports a healthy lifestyle. In addition to ensuring comfort, safety, and happiness, the sensor-rich environment should monitor the well-being of its inhabitants and effect important lifestyle changes via perceptive, pervasive, proactive and persuasive technologies.</p>
<p>By deploying a variety of infrastructure and wearable sensors in the original iCare Project (2004~2007), we have developed a number of sensor technologies, indoor localization algorithms, as well as probabilistic models to track activities of daily livings (ADLs) from sensor information about the user&rsquo;s location and object interaction context.<br /><br />The iCare 2.0 Project (2007~2010) supports context sensing from heterogeneous sensors. This sub-project plans to expand our research on activity recognition in three vital aspects:<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>To scale from simple to complex activity models &ndash; we will develop probabilistic activity models, such as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) and conditional random fields (CRF) that capture the&nbsp; dependencies among sequential and concurrent events from heterogeneous sensors.</li>
<li>To scale from certain to uncertain sensors &ndash; a broker-based distributed trust mechanism will be deployed to track the quality of data from heterogeneous sensors and context detection services.</li>
<li>To scale from complete to incomplete data &ndash; an adaptive activity recognition system will be designed with feature selection and model selection to trade off the availability of sensor data, computational requirements, and accuracy. </li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed research will build upon existing solutions from sensor technology, machine learning, sequential data analysis, distributed systems and probabilistic reasoning to create a scalable and flexible framework for activity recognition from heterogeneous contextual sensor data.</p>
